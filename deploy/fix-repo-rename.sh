# One-time fix for the GitHub repo rename (investment-committee -> money-minting-machine).
# The WIF provider's attribute-condition and the deployer SA's IAM binding were
# both still pointing at the OLD repo name, so GitHub's OIDC token (which now
# says repository=gcpcloudaccess/money-minting-machine) no longer matched and
# got rejected. This updates both to the new name.
#
# Run this yourself (not via Claude) - same reasoning as setup-gcp.sh: it
# modifies who can authenticate as your deployer service account.
