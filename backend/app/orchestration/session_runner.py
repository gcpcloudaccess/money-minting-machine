"""Session Runner: the market-hours (or replay) tick loop.

In live mode, every tick first asks app/data/exchanges.py which of
NSE/SGX/LSE/NYSE is currently open (there is only ever one active market at a
time by design) and trades that one. When the active session's exchange no
longer matches the one that's currently open - NSE closed for the day, SGX
just opened - the old session is force-closed on its own market's last known
prices exactly like an ordinary end-of-day close, and a fresh session starts
immediately on the newly-open exchange. If all 4 are closed (the daily dead
zone between US close and NSE open), the tick is a no-op, same as today's
single-exchange behavior.

Each tick, the Investment Planner picks which symbols to run, the supervisor
runs the full committee pipeline per symbol, and positions are force-closed
once the session ends (real market close, or replay data exhausted)."""
