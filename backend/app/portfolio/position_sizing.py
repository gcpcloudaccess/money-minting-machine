"""Position Sizing Agent: turns a consensus verdict + confidence into a
concrete order quantity, respecting the ₹10,000 capital / 1:2 leverage cap and
scaling exposure with both confidence and the risk regime.

Leverage is flexible, not a flat always-on 2x: any trade that actually clears
the committee's decisive threshold already represents real conviction, so it
gets meaningful leverage by default (BASE_LEVERAGE), scaling up toward the
configured ceiling (settings.leverage, default 2x for 1:2) as confidence and
risk quality improve further. This system's directional confidence realistically
ranges ~18-40% for trades that clear the decisive bar (see
trust_weighted_consensus.py) - scaling against the full 0-100% range would
make leverage nearly impossible to exercise in practice, which is exactly the
bug this was calibrated to fix: real trades were sizing well under available
*cash*, never even touching margin, let alone approaching the 2x ceiling."""
