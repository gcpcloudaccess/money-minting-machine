"""Directional Confidence-Aware Consensus — the mandatory core algorithm.

Explicitly NOT simple majority voting and NOT plain confidence averaging.
Each agent's influence on the final verdict is a product of several
independently-varying factors, recomputed fresh every tick:

    weight_i = base_confidence_i
             * expertise_relevance_i(context)      # how relevant this agent's
                                                     # domain is to an intraday call
             * trust_score_i                        # persisted, Beta-updated
                                                     # historical reliability/trust
             * agreement_adjustment_i(this tick)     # penalizes redundant agreement,
                                                       # rewards contrarian-but-reliable votes

`agreement_adjustment` is what implements the slide's worked example: an agent
that always agrees with the room contributes little new information and is
discounted, while an agent that disagrees with the room but has a strong track
record is amplified — the opposite of what majority voting or plain averaging
would do.

This module is pure Python / no I/O / no LLM calls, so the math is unit
testable with synthetic votes.

# when its individual backers are only lukewarm, while genuine BUY/SELL
# conviction from 1-2 strongly-confident agents gets diluted below it.

# candidates were consistently landing just under 18% and losing to HOLD's
# vote-count advantage tick after tick with zero trades all session - still a
# meaningful gap above LOW_CONVICTION_THRESHOLD's 10% noise floor, but low
# enough for a genuine, above-noise lean to actually execute. This is a
