"""Retrieval layer for the committee's memory: pulls a symbol's recent past
Decision rows (and, where a resulting trade has since closed, its realized
outcome) so agents can factor in what happened last time rather than
analyzing each symbol as if the committee had no history with it.

No embeddings/vector DB - this is the "SQLite decision history + recency
retrieval" memory layer from the architecture plan (PGVector was never a
hard requirement; embeddings would add an API dependency for no real benefit
at this history size). Recency + symbol match is intentionally simple and
fully explainable, consistent with the rest of this system's design bias
toward deterministic, inspectable logic over opaque similarity search."""
