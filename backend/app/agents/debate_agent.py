"""Debate Agent: sits between the analysts and the critics. Its job is to
surface the strongest contradicting views among the 7 analyst votes and
produce a synthesized read of how contested the picture actually is -
matching the architecture diagram's "Debate Agent: Agents debate
contradicting views" box in the Debate & Consensus layer.

Unlike the critics (which challenge specific domains: risk, profit, macro,
opportunity), the Debate Agent is domain-agnostic - it looks at the *shape*
of disagreement across all analysts and casts its own vote into the
trust-weighted consensus: confident when the room is lopsided, deliberately
low-confidence when the strongest bull and bear cases are evenly matched.
