# Autonomous Multi-Agent Investment Committee

Autonomous multi-agent committee that paper-trades NSE intraday: an India-only, single-exchange universe (Nifty 50 spot index `^NSEI` — yfinance has no NSE Nifty futures data, so this is a synthetic paper-only position, not a real placeable order — plus MCX gold/silver via their NSE-listed ETF proxies `GOLDBEES.NS`/`SILVERBEES.NS`, with a COMEX gold/silver futures fallback for the analysis feed only while NSE is closed, see `app/data/market_data.py`). Starts with ₹1,00,000 virtual capital, cash-only (no margin), runs a 4–6 hour session, and autonomously decides BUY / SELL / HOLD / WAIT / SWITCH per symbol using a **trust-weighted, directional-confidence-aware consensus** across 9 analyst agents and a 4-critic debate loop — never simple majority voting or plain confidence averaging.

This build targets a **hackathon-friendly, zero-Docker setup**: everything runs with just a Python virtualenv (Python 3.14 verified) and two local processes (FastAPI backend + Streamlit frontend). See [Architecture mapping](#architecture-mapping-diagram--this-build) for how each diagrammed component was implemented.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Create venv & install deps (from the investment-committee/ root)
python -m venv .venv
./.venv/Scripts/pip install -r backend/requirements.txt -r frontend/requirements.txt

# 2. Configure secrets
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# edit backend/.env: set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (or OPENAI_API_KEY + LLM_PROVIDER=openai)

# 3. Run the backend (from investment-committee/ root — this chdir's into backend/ itself)
./.venv/Scripts/python run_backend.py
# -> http://127.0.0.1:8000  (docs at /docs)

# 4. In a second terminal, run the frontend
./.venv/Scripts/python -m streamlit run frontend/Home.py
# -> http://localhost:8501
```

**Without an LLM key**, the app still runs fully — all indicator math, the consensus algorithm, position sizing, execution, and costs are pure Python and key-independent. Only the natural-language reasoning text degrades to a deterministic templated summary instead of an LLM-generated narrative. The Dashboard surfaces a warning banner if no key is configured.
**Local LLM** We are using local LLMs using Ollama using the class app/llm/local_llm.py, just need to replace it with the live LLMs using the function get_local_llm_client along with the model name.

### Data mode

- `DATA_MODE=replay` (default): downloads a window of recent historical intraday bars per symbol once (cached under `data_cache/`) and replays them tick-by-tick. Works at any time of day — good for demos.
- `DATA_MODE=live`: pulls live/delayed quotes from yfinance. Only meaningful during NSE hours (09:15–15:30 IST, Mon–Fri).

### Running a session

- The backend auto-ticks every `TICK_MINUTES` (default 10) via APScheduler once started.
- For a live demo, use the Dashboard's **"Run Tick"** button to trigger a tick on demand instead of waiting.
- The session auto-closes (force-closing all positions + generating the PDF trade log) when replay data is exhausted, or near NSE close in live mode. You can also force it early from the Dashboard ("Force Close Session") or `POST /session/close`.

### Tests

```bash
cd backend && ../.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Covers the mandatory consensus algorithm (proves it is *not* majority voting / plain averaging) and the trading/cost engine, independent of any LLM or live network call.

## Architecture mapping (diagram → this build)

| Diagram layer | This build |
|---|---|
| Data Sources | `app/data/market_data.py` (yfinance, NSE `.NS` symbols), `app/data/news_data.py` (free RSS: Google News, Moneycontrol, Economic Times; NewsAPI optional), `app/data/fundamentals.py` (yfinance fundamentals) |
| Data Ingestion (Airflow/Kafka) | In-process APScheduler tick loop (`app/orchestration/session_runner.py`) — no external ingestion infra needed for a single-process hackathon deployment |
| Multi-Agent Orchestration (LangGraph) | Custom Python orchestrator (`app/orchestration/supervisor.py`, `app/agents/`) — avoided both LangGraph and CrewAI: these agents are deterministic Python/ML with a thin LLM narration call, not LLM-driven tool-use loops, so a framework built around agentic reasoning chains wouldn't fit. `app/agents/debate_loop.py` runs all analysts (then all critics) concurrently via a bounded `ThreadPoolExecutor` (`settings.max_parallel_agents`, default 4) instead of sequentially — full unbounded parallelism was tried first and tripped Anthropic rate limits, so concurrency is capped rather than open-ended |
| Specialized Analyst Agents | 9 agents in `app/agents/analysts/`: Fundamental, Technical, Macroeconomic, Sentiment, Geopolitical, Government Policy, Risk Assessment, Algo Signal, Astrological — each wraps a custom-built tool in `app/tools/`. Several are blended with teammate-contributed engines (vendored unmodified under `backend/`): Risk Assessment blends our per-bar volatility read with `risk_agent/` (beta, Sharpe/Sortino, VaR/CVaR, liquidity/concentration/sector-exposure risk, on daily bars); Technical blends our intraday RSI/MACD with `technical_analyst_agent/` (daily-chart trend overlay); Sentiment fully replaces our lexicon with `sentiment_analyst.py` (emotion/credibility/risk-scored polarity); Algo Signal is new capability wrapping `algo_agent/` (a freshly-trained logistic regression model per tick, validated out-of-sample) reviewed by `critic_agent/` (a dedicated schema/consistency critic for that model's output); Astrological is a traditional Vedic/Jyotish planetary-position heuristic (`app/tools/planetary_positions.py` + `app/tools/astro_signals.py`, own pure-Python low-precision ephemeris, no external service) — explicitly not empirically validated, so it's capped at low confidence and given the lowest expertise weight in the consensus (`app/consensus/trust_weighted_consensus.py`) so it can only nudge, never drive, the verdict |
| Debate & Consensus Layer | `app/agents/debate_agent.py` (Debate Agent — surfaces the strongest contradicting analyst views before critique) → 4 critics in `app/agents/critics.py` (Risk, Profit, Macro, Opportunity) → `app/consensus/trust_weighted_consensus.py` (the mandatory directional confidence-aware algorithm, combining Confidence Scoring + Directional Consensus into one weighted engine) + `app/consensus/reliability_tracker.py` (persisted Beta-updated historical reliability). Evidence Fusion is implicit in how consensus aggregates each agent's evidence list, rather than a separate agent. |
| Portfolio Decision Layer | `app/portfolio/` — portfolio_manager, position_sizing (respects ₹1,00,000 cash-only cap, no margin), scenario_analysis, execution_advisor |
| Reporting & Output | `app/reporting/` — report_agent (LLM "why" narrative), visualization (Plotly equity curve), alert_agent, audit_log, pdf_export (end-of-session explainable trade log PDF) |
| Memory & Knowledge (PostgreSQL/PGVector/Redis) | SQLite via SQLAlchemy (`DATABASE_URL` swappable for Postgres later); decision/vote history queried directly (no vector store dependency); no separate cache layer (single process) |
| Monitoring & Governance (Prometheus/Grafana/LangSmith/Auth0) | Structured logging + `AuditLog` DB table only — not built; noted here as the production upgrade path |
| External Integrations (Broker APIs) | Simulated execution engine (`app/trading/execution_engine.py`) with a realistic Indian intraday cost model (`app/trading/costs.py`: brokerage, STT, exchange charges, SEBI charges, stamp duty, GST) — no live broker, this is paper trading |
| User Interface | Streamlit, single-page dashboard (`frontend/Home.py`) — portfolio KPIs, price chart, Overview/Positions & Trades/Planner & Risk/Reports tabs, and a session-control side panel (auto-trading toggle, PDF report, watchlist pulse, force-close) |

### The mandatory consensus algorithm

`app/consensus/trust_weighted_consensus.py` computes, per agent, per tick:

```
weight = confidence × expertise_relevance(context) × trust_score(persisted history) × agreement_adjustment(this tick)
```

`agreement_adjustment` discounts agents that just agree with the room (redundant signal) and amplifies agents that disagree with the room *and* have a strong track record (the "reliable contrarian" case from the spec). The final `directional_confidence` blends the winning action's *dominance* (share of trust-weighted influence) with the *conviction* of the agents backing it (their own confidence × trust) — see `backend/tests/test_consensus.py` for the proofs that this diverges from both majority voting and plain confidence averaging.
